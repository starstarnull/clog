## Bugs

- [ ] Bug 00001 - {2025-05-31} [PRIORITY:BOTTOM] Percent symbol cannot be
used in tracing or line header separator strings due to format strings. Need to
refactor to ensure that separators are arguments to a "%s" format rather than
be a format.

- [ ] Bug 00002 - {2025-06-01} [PRIORITY:BOTTOM] When configured with symbols,
tracing, and timestamps disabled, one of the separators remains.
